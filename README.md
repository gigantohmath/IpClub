* Apply your changes to the repository by this simple commands
1. git status (see what you've changed)
2. git add "file/path" (. or --all for adding all changes)
3. git commit -m "Your commit message" (needed to easily find changes whenever needed)
4. git push origin "branch name"  (it is a best practice to create a new branch for every task, so that your changes does not affect main files and they can be tested by admnistrator and then merged with main(master) branch)
* For getting changes, other people have done, simply type
